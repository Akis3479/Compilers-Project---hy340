# HY-340 Compilers Project

The role of the compiler. Lexicographic analysis, regular expressions,  
autocritical and non-autocritical autocorrelations, methods of constructing  
a lexicographic analyzer, lexicographic analyzer generators. Editorial analysis,   
grammatical independent contexts, productions, structural analysis trees,   
ambiguous grammar, elimination of ambiguous analysis. Synthetic analysis constructs,   
cathodic analysis, retrospective cathodic analysis, predictive cathodic   
analysis, LL (k), LL (1) analyzers and grammar. Abstract syntactic trees,   
ascending syntactic analysis, discrepancies in ascending analysis, LR (k), LR (1) analyzers   
and grammar. Manufacture of SLR analysis board, improvements. Grammatical features,   
syntax-driven translation, implementation in LL and LR analyzers.   
Interface code, alpha language, use of hidden variables, intermediate code generation.  
The alpha virtual machine, architecture, commands, dynamic languages, execution environment   
and memory organization, final machine code generation, virtual machine build,   
library implementation and linking. Optimization issues.   
Programming workshop: build a complete compiler using Lex and Yacc tools,   
build virtual machine, build library functions.
